      <p className="text-muted-foreground">
        Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency with no intrinsic value, but are
        traded amongst a community who share a common interest/humor. These
        coins are often created as a joke or parody, and are not intended to be
        used as a serious investment!

      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">
        The best memecoins are only as good as their community. Community
        participation is both vital, and based. Join your brothers and sisters
        in memes, and together we can spread the word â€“ the based king is coming
        for his throne.
