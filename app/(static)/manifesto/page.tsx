        In a world of uncertainty and chaos, we emerge not just as observers,
        but as active participants. We are the Concernors – the ones who see
        beyond the surface, who question the unquestionable, and who turn
        concern into action.

        Our Core Beliefs
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <b className="text-white">We are based in the origins</b> – Our roots
          run deep in the crypto culture, born from genuine concerns about the
          state of the ecosystem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b className="text-white">We build in the open</b> – No hidden
          agendas, no secret committees, just transparent development and
          community-driven growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b className="text-white">We touch grass</b> – While others theorize
          from their ivory towers, we stay grounded in reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b className="text-white">We are the pack</b> – The true strength of a
          wolf isn&apos;t in its fangs, speed, or skill – it&apos;s in the pack.
          Together, we are stronger.

        The Concernor Way
      </h2>
      <p>
        We believe in the power of collective concern. It&apos;s not just about
        pointing out problems; it&apos;s about being part of the solution.
