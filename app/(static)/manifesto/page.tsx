        always betrays.

      <p>Stay suspicious: question motives, especially the shiny ones.</p>

        <span className="text-white">Embrace open-source</span> as rebellion;
        walls are for breaking.

      <p>
        Embrace the founding principles: unstoppable code, permissionless
        building, and trustless interaction.

      <p>
        Support and champion those who foster these ideals —lend your voice,
        skills, and memes to their cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adopt and refine the tools that strengthen decentralization—action is
        the real engine of progress.

      <p>Build your pack or join one —true strength comes from unity.</p>

        hype better than any rant.

        Privacy is a right, not a luxury. Guard it fiercely.

      <p>We take what is offered, but never blindly.</p>
      <p>Share knowledge, share code —hoarding benefits no one.</p>
      <p>Worry is wisdom; let it guide, not paralyze.</p>
      <p>Resist complacency —question everything, even yourself.</p>
      <p>The future favors those who do —fail, learn, do again.</p>
      <p>Trust is earned by action.</p>

        empires.
