      <p>Decentralize or die —central power always betrays.</p>
      <p>Stay suspicious: question motives, especially the shiny ones.</p>
      <p>Embrace open-source as rebellion; walls are for breaking.</p>
      <p>Build your pack—true strength comes from unity.</p>
      <p>Humor is our weapon; memes expose hype better than any rant.</p>
      <p>Privacy is a right, not a luxury. Guard it fiercely.</p>
      <p>We take what is offered, but never blindly.</p>
      <p>Share knowledge, share code —hoarding benefits no one.</p>
      <p>Worry is wisdom; let it guide, not paralyze.</p>
      <p>Resist complacency —question everything, even yourself.</p>
      <p>The future favors those who do —fail, learn, do again.</p>
      <p>Trust is earned by action.</p>
      <p>Negotiate without mercy — if you smell BS, call it out (loudly).</p>
      <p>
        Dare to be savage in pursuit of truth; politeness rarely topples
        empires.

      <p>Step up. Do the work. Or step aside.</p>
      <p>Stay concerned.</p>
